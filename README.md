## Open Data API

You can get all the data, or partial data, from the API.  Data is returned in [geoJSON](http://geojson.org/) format and has the following structure:

```JSON
{
	"type": "FeatureCollection",
	"features": [{
		"id": 1234657,
		"type": "Feature",
		"geometry": {
			"type": "Point",

### Benches
* All Bench Data (GeoJSON)
	* `https://openbenches.org/api/benches`
	* Cached for 10 minutes - changes may not appear immediately
* Specific Bench (GeoJSON)
	* `https://openbenches.org/api/bench/123`
* Benches from a specific user
	* `https://openbenches.org/api/user/5678`
* Search Results (GeoJSON)
	* `https://openbenches.org/api/search?search=in%20loving%20memory`
* Tagged Benches (GeoJSON)
	* `https://openbenches.org/api/tag/dog`
* Benches near a location (GeoJSON)
	* `https://openbenches.org/api/nearest/?latitude=46.67583&longitude=8.245239&distance=200`
	* Distance is in Km
	* Uses the Haversine formula
* Benches near a location (GPX)
	* `https://openbenches.org/api/nearest/gpx?latitude=46.67583&longitude=8.245239&distance=200`

#### Inscriptions
* By default, the inscriptions are truncated to 128 characters.
* To get the full inscriptions, append `&truncated=false`
* `https://openbenches.org/api/benches?truncated=false`

#### Media
* By default, the API doesn't return media.
* To get media, append `https://openbenches.org/api/benches?media=true`

#### Latest
* By default, the API returns *all* results
* To get the latest 5 benches, append `&latest=5`
* `https://openbenches.org/api/benches?latest=5`

### Tags
* All available folksonomy tags
	* `https://openbenches.org/api/tags`

## Running Locally

This is a Symfony PHP and MySQL website. No need for node, complicated deploys, or spinning up containerised virtual machines in the cloud.

### Requirements

* PHP 8 or greater.
* MySQL 5.5 or greater with innodb.
* ImageMagick 6.9.4-10 or greater.

For more, see CONTRIBUTING.md

### Database Structure

In the `/database/` folder you'll find a sample database.  All text fields are `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` because we live in the future now.

Hopefully, the tables are self explanatory:

#### Benches

* `benchID`
* `latitude`
* `longitude`
* `address` text representation generated by reverse geocoding. For example "10 Downing Street, London SW1A 2AA, United Kingdom"
* `inscription` the text written on the bench
* `description` placeholder. Might be used for comments about the bench.
* `present` if a bench has been physically removed, this can be set to false.
* `published` set to FALSE if the bench has been deleted
* `added` datetime of when the bench was uploaded to the site
* `userID` foreign key

#### Users

Originally we were going to force people to sign in with Twitter / Facebook / GitHub. But that discourages use - so users are now pseudo-anonymous. Hence this weird structure!

* `userID`
* `provider` could be Twitter, GitHub, Facebook, anon etc.
* `providerID` user ID number on the provider's service.  Anonymous users stores their IP address.
* `name` their display name. Anonymous users stores the time they added a bench.

#### Media

We store the original image - smaller images are rendered dynamically.

Media storage can be complicated. Storing thousands of images in a single directory can cause problems on some systems. To get around this, we calculate the [SHA1 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) of each image. The image is stored in a subdirectory based on the hash.  For example, if the hash is `1A2B3C`, the file will be stored in `/photos/1/A/1A2B3C.jpg`

* `mediaID`
* `benchID`
* `userID`
* `sha1` A hash of the file.
* `importURL` If the image was imported from an external source - like Flickr.
* `licence` The default is `CC BY-SA 4.0`, imported images may be different.
* `media_type` We allow different types of photo - in the future, we might have other types of media.
* `width` The image's width in pixels.
* `height` The image's width in pixels.
* `datetime` The date and time the image was created - based on EXIF metadata.
* `make` The make of camera which took the photo - based on EXIF metadata.
* `model` The model of camera which took the photo - based on EXIF metadata.

#### Media Types

At the moment, we only accept photos - of the inscription, the bench, the view from the bench, a panorama, and a VR photosphere.

* `shortName` Internal ID.
* `longName` Displayed to the user.
* `displayOrder` When rendering a form in HTML, this determines the order they are presented in.

#### Licences

* `shortName` Internal ID.
* `longName` Displayed to the user.
* `url` For more information.

#### Tagging

Benches can be given multiple "tags". For example "cat" if the bench commemorates a feline, or "beach" if the bench is at the seaside.

Tagging uses the [Toxi structure](http://howto.philippkeller.com/2005/04/24/Tags-Database-schemas/).

* `tags` contains:
	* `tagID` a unique ID
	* `tagText` the displayed text

* `tag_map` contains:
	* `mapID` a unique ID
	* `tagID` the ID of a tag
	* `benchID` the ID of a bench

Tags are hard-coded in the database and can't be added or edited by regular users.
